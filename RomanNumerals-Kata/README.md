## ROMAN NUMERALS KATA

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters as the following:
- 'I' meaning '1'
- 'V' meaning '5'
- 'X' meaning '10'
- 'L' meaning '50'
- 'C' meaning '100'
- 'D' meaning '500'
- 'M' meaning '1000'.

There were also certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed.
- The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row.
- The symbols 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated.
- The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM').
- Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not). The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.

Once the rules are specified, we would like to convert Arabic numbers into
their Roman numeral equivalents.

Our acceptance criteria is:
As a game developer I want to be able to convert a number to a numeral
so that I can label my game releases using Roman numerals
