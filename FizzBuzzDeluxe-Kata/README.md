** FIZZ BUZZ DELUXE **


ROUND 1 - Fizz Buzz
You are given a number. You have to follow the following rules:
  - If the number is a multiple of three then you should write "fizz"
  - If the number is a multiple of five then you should write "buzz"
  - If the number is a multiple of both three and five then you should write "fizz buzz"
  - If the number is not a multiple of five or three then write the number, example 1

ROUND 2 - Fizz Buzz variation
Let's change the rules a little bit:
  - A number is "fizz" if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
  - A number is "buzz" if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
  - A number can be both "fizz" and "buzz" at the same time. If this happens then write "fizz buzz"

ROUND 3 - Fizz Buzz Deluxe
People like "fizz buzz" but the upper class of the society wants more. Let's create a "Deluxe" version !
It goes like this, we are going to add a new rule:
  - A number is considered to be "deluxe" if it is greater than 10 and all the digits are identical
  - A number can be "fizz", "buzz" and "deluxe" at the same time. If this happens then write "fizz buzz deluxe"

ROUND 4 - Fizz Buzz Fake Deluxe
The Deluxe version was a huge success ! Still, we are getting some negative feedback.
Turns out that people do not like odd numbers, they call them "fake".
The want us to change the Deluxe version so that:
  - If a "deluxe" number is odd, we should call him "fake deluxe"
  - A number cannot be both "deluxe" and "fake deluxe" at the same time
  - All the previous rules are still valid

ROUND 5 - Fizz Buzz Better and Improved Deluxe
Well done implementing the "fake deluxe" feature ! It had completely won the upper class people's hearts.
Now, it is time to expand to a different market. Meet the hipsters !
Our market research team came back with some interesting findings.
Turns out that the hipsters do not like our "deluxe" because all the digits are the same.
It is time to completely change the "deluxe" concept such that:
  - The old rules for "deluxe" do not apply.
  - A number is "fizz deluxe" if it is divisible by 3 AND it has a 3 in it
  - A number is "buzz deluxe" if it is divisible by 5 AND it has a 5 in it
  - We should still say "fake deluxe" if the "deluxe" number is odd
  - A number can be "fizz", "buzz" and "deluxe" at the same time. If this happens then write "fizz buzz deluxe"
  - All the previous rules for "fizz" and "buzz" are still valid
